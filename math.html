  <h1>Math Calculators</h1>

  <section class="seo-intro">
    <p>
      The Math section of Your Simple Calculator focuses on fast, clear tools for everyday numbers, starting with a powerful <strong>percentage calculator</strong> that handles discounts, percentage change, reverse discounts and markup versus margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of pushing complex formulas, the tools here are built to answer practical questions like “what is 18% of this amount”, “how much did a metric improve in percentage terms” or “what markup gives me a 25% margin”.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="seo-content">
    <h2>Available Math Calculator</h2>
    <ul class="calculator-list">
      <li>
        <a href="calculators/Math/percentage-calculator.html">Percentage Calculator</a> – solve X% of Y, reverse percentage problems, percentage increase or decrease, shopping discounts and the difference between markup and profit margin in one place.

    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use Online Math Calculators?</h2>
    <p>
      Online math calculators reduce errors and save time when you are working with repetitive percentage or ratio questions. They are especially handy for students revising topics, professionals checking reports and marketers tracking changes in conversion or click‑through rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because calculations happen instantly in your browser, you can experiment with different numbers, compare multiple scenarios and keep the page open as a lightweight alternative to a spreadsheet or physical calculator.

    <h2>Math Calculator FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Can I rely on these results for exams or official reports?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          The calculators use standard percentage formulas and are accurate for normal use, but for graded exams or audited reports you should still double‑check important numbers or follow your institution’s approved methods.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Will more math calculators be added later?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Yes. Over time this section is planned to include additional tools such as fraction, ratio and time calculators so that most everyday math problems can be solved from a single place.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Do the math calculators work on mobile?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          All calculators are designed with a responsive layout so you can comfortably use them on phones, tablets or desktops without zooming or horizontal scrolling.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Is any personal data collected when I use the calculators?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. Inputs such as numbers and percentages are processed only for the purpose of the calculation and are not stored as personal data on the server.
