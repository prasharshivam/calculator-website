  <h1>Pregnancy Due Date Calculator</h1>


  <section class="seo-intro">
  <p>
    This <strong>Pregnancy Calculator</strong> provides an estimated due date and pregnancy timeline based on the first day of your last menstrual period or the date of conception, depending on the method you use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is only an approximate guide and not a medical diagnosis, but it can help you understand which week of pregnancy you may be in and start planning discussions with your healthcare provider.

  <h2>What Does a Pregnancy Calculator Do?</h2>
  <p>
    A pregnancy calculator estimates your expected due date and current week of pregnancy using commonly followed medical guidelines. It uses key dates, such as the first day of your last period or an approximate conception date, to build a basic pregnancy timeline.
  </p>

  <h2>How Reliable Is the Estimated Due Date?</h2>
  <p>
    The due date generated by a pregnancy calculator is an estimate and not a guarantee. Many pregnancies do not follow the exact calculated date, and only a doctor or qualified healthcare professional can provide clinical confirmation through check-ups and scans.
  </p>

  <h2>Which Inputs Are Usually Needed for a Pregnancy Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    Most pregnancy calculators ask for the first day of your last menstrual period or the date of conception if known. Using this information, the calculator applies a standard counting method to estimate the expected due date and pregnancy week.
  </p>

  <h2>How Should You Use This Pregnancy Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    This pregnancy calculator is meant to be a supportive tool to help you understand a possible pregnancy timeline. It should not replace regular medical care, and any questions or concerns about your health or your baby should always be discussed with a qualified healthcare professional.
  </p>
