  <h2>What Is a BMI Calculator Used For?</h2>
  <p>
    A BMI calculator is used to estimate Body Mass Index, which is a simple ratio of weight to height. It gives a broad indication of whether your weight may be in a range that is typically described as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese for adults.
  </p>

  <h2>How Should You Read Your BMI Result?</h2>
  <p>
    The BMI value is usually compared with standard ranges to categorise weight status. While a normal range may suggest a balanced weight for most adults, only a healthcare professional can interpret your BMI result in the context of your overall health, body type, and medical history.
  </p>

  <h2>What Factors Can Influence BMI Interpretation?</h2>
  <p>
    BMI does not directly measure body fat or muscle mass, so factors like age, fitness level, body composition, and medical conditions can influence how the number should be interpreted. This is why BMI is best used as a starting point rather than a final diagnosis.
  </p>

  <h2>How Can This BMI Calculator Support Your Health Goals?</h2>
  <p>
    This BMI calculator offers a quick way to check your current weight category and track changes over time. It can motivate you to review your daily habits and, where necessary, seek personalised guidance from a doctor, nutritionist, or fitness expert.

      <p>
        Highly muscular individuals may have a higher BMI even if their body fat is low, so their BMI result may not reflect their actual health status. In such cases, additional assessments are usually recommended by professionals.
