    <p>
      This <strong>401(k) Calculator</strong> helps you estimate how your retirement savings might grow over time, how much an employer match could add, and what happens if you take money out of a 401(k) before retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbers are simplified projections and are not tax, investment, or financial advice. Actual outcomes depend on market performance, plan rules, fees, and your personal tax situation.

    <h2>How This 401(k) Calculator Can Be Used</h2>
    <p>
      The projections on this page use simplified assumptions to give you a rough idea of how your 401(k) contributions, employer match and investment returns might add up over time. 
      They can be a useful starting point for conversations with a financial professional or for comparing different saving scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early withdrawal section highlights how income taxes and potential IRS penalties can reduce the amount you actually receive if you take money out of a traditional 401(k) before typical retirement age. 
      It is only an estimate and does not replace personalised tax advice or plan guidance.

      This 401(k) calculator does not know your full financial situation, plan rules or future tax law.

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          This calculator estimates how your 401(k) balance might grow over time based on your current balance, salary, contribution rate, employer match and an assumed average annual return. It also gives a simplified illustration of potential taxes and penalties on early withdrawals.

        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. The results are hypothetical examples that depend on the numbers you enter and on constant assumptions. Actual 401(k) balances, investment returns, fees and tax outcomes will differ from these estimates.

        How is the employer match calculated in this tool?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          The calculator uses the employer match percentage and “match up to” percentage you enter to estimate how much your employer might add each year. Real‑world plan rules can be more complex, so check your plan documents for precise matching formulas and limits.

      <button class="faq-question">
        How does the early withdrawal penalty section work?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          For traditional 401(k) accounts, the early withdrawal tool applies the federal and state tax rates you enter and, when age is under 59½, it normally adds a 10% early distribution penalty. If you select a potential IRS exception, the calculator shows how the penalty might change in that scenario while still applying regular income tax.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Does choosing an IRS exception here mean I qualify in real life?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. The exception options are for educational illustration only and do not confirm that you qualify. IRS rules contain detailed requirements and may change over time. Always confirm your actual eligibility with a tax professional, financial advisor or plan administrator before taking a withdrawal.

        <p>
