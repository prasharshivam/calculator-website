  <h2>What Is Simple Interest?</h2>
  <p>
    Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount for the entire duration of the loan or investment. The interest does not compound, which makes the calculation straightforward and easier to understand.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Use a Simple Interest Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A simple interest calculator saves time by performing the calculation for you and reducing the chances of manual errors. It helps you compare different loan or deposit options where interest is charged or paid on a flat basis.
  </p>

  <h2>Which Inputs Do You Need for Simple Interest?</h2>
  
  <p>
  To calculate simple interest, you usually need the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the time period. This calculator also lets you choose different time units and, if needed, work backwards to estimate the principal, rate, or time required to reach a target amount.
  </p>


  <h2>How Can This Simple Interest Calculator Help in Planning?</h2>
  <p>
    This simple interest calculator helps you understand how much interest is associated with a loan or deposit before you make a decision. By adjusting the principal, rate, or time, you can see how each factor affects the final amount you owe or receive.
