  <h2>What Does a Mortgage Calculator Do?</h2>
  <p>
    A mortgage calculator estimates the monthly instalment you may pay for a home loan by considering the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment tenure. It gives you a quick way to see whether a particular property or loan option fits your monthly budget.<p>
  This calculator also shows the total amount payable and the estimated interest cost, and lets you test the impact of adding an extra monthly payment to see how it could shorten your loan term.
</p>

  </p>

  <h2>Why Should You Use a Mortgage Calculator Before Applying?</h2>
  <p>
    Using a mortgage calculator before you apply helps you compare different scenarios without affecting your credit profile. You can experiment with various loan amounts and tenures to find a comfortable EMI range instead of relying only on generic estimates.
  </p>

  <h2>Which Inputs Influence Your Mortgage EMI the Most?</h2>
  <p>
    The three key inputs that influence your mortgage EMI are the principal amount, the annual interest rate, and the loan tenure. A higher loan amount or interest rate usually increases the EMI, while a longer tenure can reduce the EMI but may increase the total interest paid over time.
  </p>

  <h2>How Can This Mortgage Calculator Help With Financial Planning?</h2>
  <p>
    By showing an estimated EMI and total repayment, this mortgage calculator helps you plan your monthly budget more realistically. It can also support conversations with lenders or advisors when you are comparing different loan offers and repayment strategies.
