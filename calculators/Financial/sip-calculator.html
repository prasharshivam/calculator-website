  <h2>What Is a SIP Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A SIP calculator is an online tool that estimates the maturity amount you may receive by investing a fixed sum at regular intervals. It uses your monthly contribution, expected return rate, and investment period to project potential future value.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Should You Use a SIP Calculator Before Investing?</h2>
  <p>
    Using a SIP calculator before investing helps you see how small, consistent investments can grow over time. It allows you to test different amounts and durations, so you can align your investment plan with goals such as education, a home purchase, or retirement.
  </p>

  <h2>Which Inputs Affect SIP Returns the Most?</h2>
  <p>
    SIP returns are mainly influenced by the monthly investment amount, the expected annual rate of return, and the total investment duration. Increasing the amount, staying invested for longer, or achieving a higher return rate can significantly change the projected maturity value.
  </p>

  <h2>How Can This SIP Calculator Support Your Financial Planning?</h2>
  <p>
    This SIP calculator gives you a clear, numerical view of how your investments may grow if you stay disciplined. By adjusting different values, you can decide how much to invest regularly and how long to stay invested to move closer to your long-term financial targets.
