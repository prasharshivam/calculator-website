    <h2>How This SIP Calculator Works</h2>
    <p>
      The SIP calculator uses the standard SIP formula \( FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r) \) where P is the monthly SIP, r is monthly return, and n is the number of months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inflation-adjusted purchasing power is calculated by dividing the future value by \( (1 + i)^{years} \), where i is the inflation rate, so you can see what your future corpus is worth in today's money.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Inflation-Adjusted SIP Planning Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Most calculators only show the final corpus number, which can be misleading because rising prices reduce how much that corpus can buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By including inflation in every SIP scenario, this tool helps you plan realistically for long-term goals like retirement, children's education, or early financial independence.
    </p>

    <h2>Standard SIP vs Step-Up SIP</h2>
    <p>
      In a standard SIP, your contribution stays constant for the entire tenure, while in a step-up SIP your contribution grows every year by a fixed percentage like 5–10%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step-up SIPs better reflect a typical salary path and can meaningfully increase your final corpus without feeling too heavy in the early years.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal-Based Reverse SIP Calculation</h2>
    <p>
      The goal-based mode takes your desired goal value in today's terms and converts it into a future value using your inflation assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      It then uses an iterative calculation to find the monthly SIP needed to hit that target, helping you decide if your goal is affordable or needs adjustment.
    </p>
    <h2>Online SIP Calculator for Mutual Funds</h2>
  <p>
    This free <strong>SIP calculator</strong> is a simple <em>systematic investment plan calculator</em> that shows how regular monthly investing can grow over time. It works as a practical <em>SIP plan calculator</em> and <em>SIP investment plan calculator</em>, letting you test different amounts, returns and durations in seconds instead of using spreadsheets.[web:522][web:526][web:532]
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter your monthly SIP, expected annual return and investment period to see total investment, estimated maturity value and a clear breakdown of how compounding drives your mutual fund SIP returns. The goal is to make a complex <em>systematic investment calculator</em> feel as easy as a basic <em>SIP cal</em> while still showing useful detail.[web:523][web:528][web:541]
  </p>

  <h2>Systematic Investment Plan Calculator for Mutual Funds</h2>
  <p>
    Your Simple Calculator can be used as a <strong>mutual fund calculator</strong> or <em>mf calculator</em> for SIP‑based investing. Because SIPs are one of the most popular ways to invest in equity and hybrid funds, a reliable <em>mutual fund investment calculator</em> helps you see how disciplined monthly contributions stack up against your long‑term financial goals.[web:525][web:526][web:533]
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike a one‑time lump sum tool, this <em>mutual fund SIP calculator</em> factors in the effect of repeated contributions and compounding. That makes it useful whether you are planning a new SIP, reviewing an existing SIP investment plan, or comparing two different schemes using the same <em>systematic investment plan calculator</em> logic.[web:528][web:532]
  </p>

  <h2>SIP Return Calculator with Goal and Step‑Up Options</h2>
  <p>
    The advanced modes allow you to treat the tool as a flexible <strong>mf return calculator</strong>. With goal‑based SIP, you enter the target amount and the calculator works backward to estimate how much you need to invest each month. With step‑up SIP, you can see how increasing your SIP every year boosts potential long‑term wealth.[web:530][web:538][web:539]
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that every <em>muchhal fund calculator</em> or <em>mutual fund investment calculator</em> can only provide estimates based on assumed rates of return. Actual mutual fund performance, costs and taxes may differ, so consider this SIP return calculator a planning aid rather than a promise of future results.[web:531][web:534][web:535]

        What is a SIP in mutual funds?

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          A SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, is a way of investing a fixed amount at regular intervals in a mutual fund instead of investing a lump sum in one go.

        How does this SIP calculator work?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          This SIP calculator takes your monthly SIP amount, expected annual return, investment period, inflation rate, and optional step-up rate to estimate both future value and inflation-adjusted purchasing power.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="faq-question">
        Is the SIP calculator result guaranteed?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No, the result is only an illustration. Actual returns depend on mutual fund performance, market conditions, and your behaviour, so the final amount may be higher or lower than the estimate.

      <button class="faq-question">
        Can I use this SIP calculator for different goals?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Yes, you can use this SIP calculator for goals like education, buying a home, or retirement by changing the SIP amount, investment duration, expected return, and inflation rate to fit each target.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        What is a step-up SIP and why should I use it?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          A step-up SIP increases your contribution by a fixed percentage each year, matching your expected salary hikes. It lets you start small and gradually invest more without putting pressure on your current budget.
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        How does the goal-based SIP mode help in planning?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          The goal-based mode calculates the monthly SIP you need to reach a target amount in today's money, after considering both returns and inflation, so you can decide whether to change your goal, timeline, or SIP amount.
