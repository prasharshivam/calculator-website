  <h2>What Does an ROI Calculator Show?</h2>
  <p>
    An ROI calculator shows how much return you have earned compared to the amount you initially invested. It expresses the result as a percentage, making it easier to compare different investments, campaigns, or business decisions on the same scale.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Is Calculating ROI Important?</h2>
  <p>
    Calculating ROI is important because it helps you understand whether the time, money, and effort you invested are delivering meaningful results. It supports more informed decisions, whether you are reviewing a marketing campaign, a new tool subscription, or a product launch.
  </p>

  <h2>Which Inputs Do You Need for an ROI Calculation?</h2>
  <p>
    To calculate ROI, you typically need the total cost of your investment and the final value or gain generated from it. For recurring activities such as subscriptions or campaigns, you can also compare monthly costs and revenues over a chosen period to understand performance and estimate annualised ROI.
  </p>


  <h2>How Can This ROI Calculator Help Your Planning?</h2>
  <p>
    This ROI calculator provides a quick way to test different assumptions before committing additional resources. By adjusting the cost and expected return values, you can set realistic targets, compare options, and prioritise the activities that are most likely to create value.
