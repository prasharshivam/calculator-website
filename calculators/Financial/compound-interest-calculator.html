  <h2>How Does Compound Interest Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Compound interest is calculated by applying interest not only on the original principal but also on the interest earned during previous periods. Over time, this compounding effect can significantly increase the total value.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Use a Compound Interest Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A compound interest calculator helps you visualize growth over time and compare different interest rates and durations. It is useful for planning long-term savings and understanding how time impacts returns.
  </p>

  <h2>What Factors Affect Compound Interest?</h2>
  <p>
    The final amount depends on the principal amount, interest rate, compounding frequency, and the total investment duration. Even small changes in these factors can produce different results.<span>
  This calculator lets you adjust the compounding frequency, choose a currency symbol, and include a regular monthly contribution so you can see how different saving patterns may change the final amount.
