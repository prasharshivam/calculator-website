    <h2>Other Calculators FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Is any personal or channel data stored when I use these calculators?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. Inputs such as your date of birth, view counts or RPM assumptions are processed only to generate results in your browser and are not stored as personal identifiers on the server.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Can I use the age calculator for multiple people or events?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Yes. You can reuse the tool as many times as you like by entering different dates of birth and comparison dates to check ages for family members, clients or historical events.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Does the YouTube income calculator work for Shorts and non‑ad revenue?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          The tool is primarily tuned for long‑form ad revenue and Premium RPM. You can enter Shorts views for a rough idea, but actual payouts may differ because Shorts use a separate revenue pool and distribution model.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Yes. You can use the calculators to support your own planning, reporting or client work, provided you treat results as estimates and verify important decisions with appropriate professional advice when necessary.
