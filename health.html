    <h2>How to Use Health Calculators Safely</h2>
    <p>
      Online health tools are most useful when they start a conversation rather than replace it. Use your BMI or pregnancy due date result as a starting point, then share it with your healthcare provider, who can interpret it in the context of your age, medical history and any existing conditions.[web:420][web:423]
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid making major changes to medication, diet or exercise based only on online calculators. When in doubt, schedule a professional check‑up instead of self‑diagnosing.[web:420][web:432]

        Do these calculators replace visiting a doctor?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. They are educational tools that help you understand basic numbers before or after an appointment. Only a qualified healthcare professional can diagnose, treat or manage medical conditions.

      <button class="faq-question">
        Is my health data stored when I use these tools?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Inputs such as your height, weight or dates are processed in your browser only for calculation. The tools are not designed to collect or store personal health information.

        Can I use the pregnancy calculator with irregular cycles?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          You can still get an estimate, but irregular cycles may make the due date less precise. In such cases, ultrasound measurements and guidance from your healthcare provider become even more important.

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
