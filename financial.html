    <h2>How These Financial Calculators Help You Decide</h2>
    <p>
      Good financial decisions need numbers, not guesses. These calculators highlight EMIs, interest costs, maturity values and returns so you can compare options like rent versus buy, SIP versus lump sum, or one loan offer against another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the tools are free and anonymous, you can try multiple scenarios—changing interest rates, tenures or contribution amounts—until you find a plan that fits both your monthly budget and long‑term goals.

        Are these financial calculators suitable for beginners?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Do the calculators store or share my financial data?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          No. The tools run entirely in your browser and do not ask for account numbers, PAN, bank logins or other sensitive data. You can experiment with different scenarios without creating an account.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Can I use these calculators for professional or client work?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Many users refer to these calculators when preparing client proposals or internal plans. They are a helpful starting point, but final advice and documentation should always be checked against current product terms and local regulations.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Will results match exactly with bank or mutual fund statements?
        <span class="icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Real‑world payouts can differ slightly because of rounding rules, tax treatment, fees and product‑specific terms. Treat the calculator outputs as close estimates rather than guaranteed values.
