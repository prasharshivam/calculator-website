  <section class="content-section">
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how information may be collected and used when you visit <strong>yoursimplecalculator.com</strong> (“Your Simple Calculator”, “the website”, “we”, or “us”). 
      The site offers free online calculators for finance, health, math and everyday tasks, and is intended for general information purposes only.

    <h2>Information You Enter in Calculators</h2>
    <p>
      The calculators on this website work with the numbers you type into the input fields, such as loan amounts, interest rates, salaries, dates or health‑related values. 
      These values are processed in your browser to show the result and are not intended to identify you personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should avoid entering names, account numbers, or any sensitive personal details into the calculators because they are not required for the tools to function.
