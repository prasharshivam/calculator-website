  <h1>About Your Simple Calculator</h1>

  <section class="content-section">
    <p>
      Your Simple Calculator is a small, independent project created to make everyday calculations faster and less confusing. 
      The website brings together focused tools for finance, health, math, and daily planning so that you can get clear numbers without downloading apps or signing up for an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each calculator is designed to be straightforward: you enter a few values, get an instant result, and can adjust the inputs as many times as you like. 
      The goal is to remove jargon and present calculations in a format that most people can understand at a glance.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Can Do Here</h2>
    <p>
      Your Simple Calculator includes tools for tasks such as checking loan payments, estimating savings growth, reviewing salary and tax scenarios, monitoring health metrics, and solving basic math questions. 
      New calculators are added over time based on questions that people frequently search for and topics that are useful in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Results from the calculators are intended for general information and planning. 
      They are not professional financial, medical, or legal advice, and important decisions should always be discussed with a qualified expert or service provider.
